# CyberPunk-ttrpg
creating a website for my tabletop group to use for our cyberpunk red game

9/15/2024-
Restarting this project from ground up, going to be trying some different things as well as using some new tools. I will be using the following tools:

- [ ] [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [ ] [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ ] [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ ] [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Hopefully this will get me a better result than the last time I tried to make this website. I will be using the following resources to help me along the way:

- [ ] [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [ ] [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [ ] [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- [ ] [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

I will also be using youtube to help me along the way mostly in the form of shamisen trap and tutorials, though I am not sure which ones yet.
